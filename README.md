This matlab program recognizes number said by the user using machine 
learning and the KNN algorithm to determine what number is said by the 
user.

The audio files right now only work with my voice. However all the files 
can be deleted and the user can make their own. Use the file recordsound 
in a while loop to record your voice saying a number multiple times to 
get the machine to learn them. 

The audio1 folder means I only use one file for each number for machine 
learning, audio10 means I use 10 files for each number, and audio175 
means I use ~175 audio files for machine learning per number.

Remember to add the voicebox folder to file path because this program 
uses MFCC's as feature for sound.
